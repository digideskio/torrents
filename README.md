# Torrents

This is a prototype torrent client. Based on [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org).

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

Double click on `torrents.cmd` executable or:

```
npm start
```

## Register .torrent files and magnet links

The app will attempt to make itself as the default for .torrent files and magnet protocol, though it needs to be ran as admin for it to work.
